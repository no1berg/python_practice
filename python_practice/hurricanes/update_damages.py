# # Hurricane Analysis

# #### Overview

# This project is slightly different than others you have encountered thus far. Instead of a step-by-step tutorial, this project contains a series of open-ended requirements which describe the project you'll be building. There are many possible ways to correctly fulfill all of these requirements, and you should expect to use the internet, Codecademy, and other resources when you encounter a problem that you cannot easily solve.

# #### Project Goals

# You will work to write several functions that organize and manipulate data about Category 5 Hurricanes, the strongest hurricanes as rated by their wind speed. Each one of these functions will use a number of parameters, conditionals, lists, dictionaries, string manipulation, and return statements.

# #### Prerequisites

# In order to complete this project, you should have completed the Loops and Dictionaries sections of the [Learn Python 3 Course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3). This content is also covered in the [Data Scientist Career Path](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/data-science/).

# ## Project Requirements

# 1. Hurricanes, also known as cyclones or typhoons, are one of the most powerful forces of nature on Earth. Due to climate change caused by human activity, the number and intensity of hurricanes has risen, calling for better preparation by the many communities that are devastated by them. As a concerned environmentalist, you want to look at data about the most powerful hurricanes that have occured. 
# 
#    Begin by looking at the `damages` list. The list contains strings representing the total cost in USD(`$`) caused by `34` category 5 hurricanes (wind speeds $\ge$ 157 mph (252 km/h)) in the Atlantic region. For some of the hurricanes, damage data was not recorded (`"Damages not recorded"`), while the rest are written in the format `"Prefix-B/M"`, where `B` stands for billions (`1000000000`) and `M` stands for millions (`1000000`).
#    
#    Write a function that returns a new list of updated damages where the recorded data is converted to float values and the missing data is retained as `"Damages not recorded"`.
#    
#    Test your function with the data stored in `damages`.

# In[79]:


# damages (USD($)) of hurricanes
damages = ['Damages not recorded', '100M', 'Damages not recorded', '40M',
          '27.9M', '5M', 'Damages not recorded', '306M', '2M', '65.8M',
          '326M', '60.3M', '208M', '1.42B', '25.4M', 'Damages not recorded',
          '1.54B', '1.24B', '7.1B', '10B', '26.5B', '6.2B', '5.37B', '23.3B',
          '1.01B', '125B', '12B', '29.4B', '1.76B', '720M', '15.1B', '64.8B',
          '91.6B', '25.1B']

# 1
# Update Recorded Damages
conversion = {"M": 1000000,
             "B": 1000000000}

# Function to convert damages from custom format into floats
def custom_to_float(custom_list):
    updated_list = []
    for record in custom_list:
        if record == 'Damages not recorded':
            updated_list.append(record)
        else:
            record_converted = float(record[:-1]) * conversion[record[-1]]
            updated_list.append(record_converted)
    return updated_list
# test function by updating damages
damages = custom_to_float(damages)
print(damages)
